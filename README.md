# weather_app

A new Flutter project.

The project is using API from openweathermap.org

To run the application on simulators please obtain the **API key** first by registering/signing in to the openweathermap.org

The **API key** is passed via environmental variable to the application.
For that please navigate to the project folder and run the command (substitute the **APPID** with the actual **API key** obtained from openweathermap.org):
`flutter run --dart-define appid=APPID`
